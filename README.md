# Data Structure and Algorithms
Data Structure and Algorithm is a crucial part in programming for a developer.

Problem solving isn't tough but solving a problem efficiently is what matters.
Data structures allow developers to do find an efficient solution for the problem.


A good algorithm usually comes together with a set of good data structures that allow the algorithm to manipulate the data efficiently.

So this repository aims at providing well-documented topic-wise codes for data structures and algorithms.
Most of the codes are written in C or C++ language but can easily be converted into java or python.
